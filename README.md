# Recap-Pro-Data-set
A dataset has been created to assess the overall performance of Recap Pro. This dataset comprises 398 image links, each paired with an incorrect and correct caption. The images cover a diverse range of classes that the sub-models have been trained on, and the image links were sourced from the internet, while the inaccurate and accurate captions were manually assigned.
The classes this dataset covers are: 
Noun classes: ['airplane','automobile','bird','cat','deer','dog','frog','horse','ship','truck']
Verb classes: ['snowboard', 'ride'], ['surfboard', 'carry'], ['laptop', 'hold'], ['motorcycle', 'sit on'], ['knife', 'cut with'], ['cake', 'cut'], ['keyboard', 'type on'], ['toothbrush', 'brush with'], ['bottle', 'hold'], ['couch', 'lie on']
