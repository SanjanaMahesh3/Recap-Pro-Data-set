# Recap-Pro-Data-set
A dataset has been created to assess the overall performance of Recap Pro. This dataset comprises 400 image links, each paired with an incorrect and correct caption. The images cover a diverse range of classes that the sub-models have been trained on, and the image links were sourced from the internet, while the inaccurate and accurate captions were manually assigned.

The classes this dataset covers are: 

Noun classes: ['airplane', 'automobile', 'bird', 'cat', 'deer', 'dog', 'frog', 'horse', 'ship', 'truck'].

Verb classes: ['snowboard', 'ride'], ['surfboard', 'carry'], ['laptop', 'hold'], ['motorcycle', 'sit on'], ['knife', 'cut with'], ['cake', 'cut'], ['keyboard', 'type on'], ['toothbrush', 'brush with'], ['bottle', 'hold'], ['couch', 'lie on'].
